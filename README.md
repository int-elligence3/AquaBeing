AquaBeing is a community with a vision to heal the water bodies and spreading awareness among the people to keep their surroundings clean. As we know that the pollution rate of water is increasing tremendously, so now it's in our hands to protect it by giving a helping hand to our mother Earth in rejuvenating herself. 
Our community helps in motivating people to do social good and make the planet bluer. We welcome those who want to help us in this cause, we’d be really grateful if you could donate and help us in expanding our vision. The funds that we’ll get, would help us to reward our volunteers and hence inspire them further for doing good deeds.
Devote yourselves towards cleaning of water bodies and play your part in nurturing nature!
Volunteer now!
